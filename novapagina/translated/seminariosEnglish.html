                    <strong>Lecture Summary:</strong>  Agriculture plays an important role in society, being one of the
                    main sources of food in the world. With the population increasing, it is necessary to increase the
                    productivity and exportation of agricultural food. To aid crop production and yield, precision
                    agriculture makes use of technologies to support the producer, aiming at greater productivity and
                    quality of agricultural commodities. These technologies include remote sensing, which uses
                    satellites, drones, unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as automated robots, digital cameras and
                    smartphones. One of the problems encountered by farmers is diseases affecting plants, failure to
                    detect these diseases early can result in minor or major damage to the final yield of a crop. In
                    this paper, we present a review of studies that use digital image processing and neural networks to
                    detect plant diseases.<br /><strong>Place and Date: </strong>DTIC, Room 201, Monday, June 24, at

                    <strong>Lecture Summary:</strong> One of the first steps when working with Software Process
                    Improvement (MPS) is to make the diagnosis. Currently in the industry, every professional or
                    consulting firm has its own ad hoc process for making the diagnosis. This usually includes
                    interviews, questionnaires, local observation, among other practices. Thus, the work proposes to
                    investigate what are the solutions already proposed to systematize the diagnostic process in MPS.
                    Such solutions can be methods, protocols, frameworks, tools, among others, to support the diagnostic
                    process.<br /><strong>Place and Date: </strong>DTIC, Room 201, Monday, June 24, at

                    in the entire software development process, including multi-agent systems. The development of this
                    type of system has grown and applied in several areas due, among other reasons, to its ability to
                    cope with complexity. However, multi-agent systems have specific requirements, so requirements
                    engineering must be adapted to suit the correct representation of those
                    requirements.<br /><strong>Place and Date: </strong>DTIC, Room 201, Tuesday, June 25, at

                        Summary:</strong> Scoping is an essential activity in software product line engineering. This
                    causes a very large number of approaches to be proposed for the area. Given this large number,
                    identifying these approaches is not an easy task. One way to achieve this result is through a
                    systematic review. Therefore, this paper proposes and reports the results of a systematic literature
                    review conducted with the following objectives: 1) List approach for Scoping of software product
                    lines; 2) Identify technical information about proposals, such as scoping strategies; 3) Identify
                    the research methodologies of the proposals, such as applied evaluations.<br /><strong>Place and

                        Summary:</strong>Software defined networks is a new paradigm in the data transfer area where the
                    data plane is separated from the control plane. These networks have some advantages, such as better
                    granularity of traffic control. One of the challenges for deploying this network is the cost of
                    equipment. This paper presents research on the feasibility of deploying an SDN in a small business
                    scenario using a low cost controller.<br /><strong>Place and Date: </strong>DTIC, Room 201,

                        Theme:</strong> Use of In-Band Telemetry for Computer Network Anomaly Detection<br />
                    <strong>Lecture Summary:</strong> Datacenters need to handle a large amount of information resulting
                    from various services. To prevent data flow from being impaired, network management needs to be
                    optimally managed, thus minimizing performance losses. However, solving the incident is not enough,
                    as detection and resolution time directly influence network performance and can disrupt real-time
                    services such as streaming video, audio, and therefore quality of experience (QoE). This paper aims
                    to elucidate the importance of the qualified selection of metrics for the detection of transient and
                    persistent anomalies in the use of in-band telemetry. These metrics are dynamically associated with
                    computer networking issues.<br /><strong>Place and Date: </strong>DTIC, Room 201, Friday, June 28,

                        Theme:</strong>Reducing Processor Aging Through Thread-Throttling<br /><strong>Lecture
                        Summary:</strong> To meet the increasing performance demands of modern applications, the number
                    of colors in a single chip package has been increasing. However, dissipated power and temperature
                    have been growing at a higher rate, accelerating the aging process of new processors. Since a
                    significant number of parallel applications are unbalanced, in many cases performance stagnates
                    after a number of concurrent threads start running. In these cases, the only effect is a processor
                    temperature increase, which dramatically accelerates aging. Given this, we propose an automatic and
                    transparent approach to reducing processor aging by automatically adjusting the number of threads
                    for OpenMP applications at run time. Our tool, Geras, is fully transparent to the end user, so even
                    compiled binaries can be optimized.<br /><strong>Place and Date: </strong>DTIC, Room 201, Friday the
