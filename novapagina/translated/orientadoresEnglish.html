                    Research Areas: High Performance Processing, Parallel Programming, Scientific Applications, and
                    Cloud Computing Description: In several areas of science there are algorithms that demand a high
                    computational cost. An alternative to speeding up the execution of these algorithms is concurrent
                    code execution, making obtaining numerical solutions feasible or obtained within an acceptable
                    processing time. Multicore architectures and multi-core accelerators have been widely used as an
                    efficient and viable alternative in the pursuit of higher processing power. Modern systems are
                    comprised of highly specialized multicore processors and accelerators such as GPUs and Intel Xeon
                    Phi coprocessors. However, making use of this type of architecture requires distinct programming
                    aspects, which should therefore be properly investigated to ensure the maximum use of computational
                    resources. Thus, using different combined parallel programming interfaces, it is possible to compare
                    and analyze ways to get the best out of hardware and consequently provide more efficient program
                    executions. Based on this context, this research investigates how to explore different forms of
                    parallelism for various application classes using appropriate parallel programming interfaces,
                    evaluate the performance of current architectures, and propose application parallel division
                    techniques. Using different programming interfaces allows us to make use of a larger set of
                    computational architectures such as multiprocessors / multicore, manycore / coprocessors and
                    multicomputers. In this way it will be possible to provide higher performance in the execution of
                    scientific and commercial applications in current architectures and, consequently, have faster and /
                    or more accurate solutions, besides using and proposing algorithms for the evaluation of
                    computational architectures. </p>

                    Optimization with an emphasis on Virtualized Network Functions (NFV) and Software Defined Networks
                    (SDN) <em> Description: </em> In-band Plane Telemetry Data collection is an emerging paradigm for
                    monitoring network infrastructures. From distributed, real-time collection of monitoring
                    information, you can gain greater visibility into infrastructure status and identify a larger set of
                    problems — especially those with short duration such as micro-bursts. Recent studies in the area
                    have focused efforts on developing mechanisms to (i) increase the visibility level of network
                    infrastructures and (ii) to design new monitoring solutions. However, little has been done to
                    coordinate the process of collecting telemetry information in this new paradigm. This is
                    particularly challenging mainly for two reasons. First, depending on what network telemetry items
                    are collected, infrastructure visibility can degrade substantially in terms of consistency and
                    update. Second, depending on how telemetry items are collected, the performance of operating network
                    services and monitoring applications may be impaired. In this project, we intend to investigate and
                    model the planning problem of in-band telemetry item collection. The idea is to explore the dynamism
                    between the requirements of monitoring applications and the acquisition of telemetry items in order
                    to ensure the accuracy of the state of infrastructure and monitoring applications. Subsequently, it
                    is intended, using the acquired knowledge, to investigate strategies for the operationalization of
                    solutions obtained in an infrastructure with support for programmability.<br /><br /></p>

                    Networks, Computer Networks, Distributed Systems and Computer Systems Security. <em> Description:
                    </em> Information Centered Networks (Information-Centric Networking - ICN) is a paradigm for the
                    Future Internet focused on efficient content dissemination, which is the main application
                    responsible for the growth of Internet traffic according to recent studies. After years of research
                    and development, ICN is reaching sufficient maturity to be experimentally evaluated in a real
                    environment for deployment on the Future Internet. To evaluate the feasibility and potentiality of
                    ICN deployment, it is essential to conduct experiments in real operational networks and in
                    inter-domain context. The overall objective of this project is to experimentally evaluate ICN.
                    Initially, we will conduct, locally in a controlled environment, a comprehensive, comprehensive and
                    rigorous comparative assessment of the various recently proposed ICN alternatives. We will then
                    conduct a benchmarking on distributed testbeds (like PlanetLab) of the most promising alternative in
                    the previous step. </p>
