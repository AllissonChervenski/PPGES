                        Program in Software Engineering (PPGES), at professional master level, has a character focused
                        mainly on applied research in the industry and the training of qualified human resources in the
                        field of Software Engineering. It is divided into two lines of research: 1) Software Engineering
                        Applied to Computing, and 2) Methodologies and Technologies for Software Engineering. English

                        paid in compulsory DPG (Software Development, Algorithm Optimization and Complexity, and
                        Software Engineering Experiment) and the remainder in other, optional subjects. selection. The
                        regular deadline for completion of the course is 24 months, and upon delivery of the volume for
                        forwarding the dissertation defense the student must attach an opinion of the partner
                        organization and the advisor, informing the delivery and validation of artifacts proposed in the

                        study according to his research line and his dissertation theme. It is noteworthy that the
                        syllabus should focus primarily on the needs of member companies, incubated in PAMPATEC or
                        companies and public agencies that have an agreement with UNIPAMPA PPGES. Interaction with the
                        organization's agents is motivated, and they can act as tutors, providing student technical
                        support and facilitating access to documents, tools, development artifacts, and organization
                        experts. Mentors should also work collaboratively with the student and tutor to clearly align
                        their line of research with the research problem that is of interest to the partner company or
                        public agency.<br><br></p>
